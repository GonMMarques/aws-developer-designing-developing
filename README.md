## Code used to complete the AWS Developer: AWS Developer: Designing and Developing

The scope of the course is to know more about AWS. It follows the AWS Developer: Getting Started course. 
It goes deeper on the usage of the AWS SDK. It was built on AW services like:
- EC2
- AMI
- ELB
- Auto Scaling and Launch Configurations
- S3
- EBS
- DynamoDB
- RDS (mySQL)
- ElastiCache
- Route 53
- API Gateway
- CloudFront
- S3 as Static Website
- SQS
- Kinesis through Lambda
- SNS
- CloudWatch

For more info check out the [original repository](https://github.com/ryanmurakami/hbfl) and also check the 
[AWS Developer: Designing and Developing course on Pluralsight.com](www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-developer-designing-developing). 

I highly recommend this course if you are getting started (like me on) the AWS world!
